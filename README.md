# NeoVars BUT

This AutoHotKey script is a modified version of the original NEO keyboard layout and supports "Aus der Neo-Welt" layouts and it's variants. I've taken the original source from http://adnw.de/index.php?n=Main.Downloads and added additional code to make this driver portable. If you have used the non-portable version before, the configuration will still be read/written to ```%APPDATA%\Neo2\Neo2.ini```. If this config is not found, the configuration will be placed into the directory of the executable.

More information about the modifications of the driver can be found [here](http://www.adnw.de/uploads/Main/OptimierungF%C3%BCrDieGeradeTastaturMitDaumen-Shift/PUQ30_Vars.pdf) (German only).
